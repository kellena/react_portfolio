            I'm a former cook and restaurant manager, current aspiring web developer who has 
            experience working with both front-end and back-end development!  My strengths 
            lie in creating slick, high-clarity layouts for websites.  While I am currently
            finishing up a boot-camp program via the University of Minnesota, I look
            forward to starting my new career soon!
